# MEGA: Memory Episode Gaze Anticipation

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the paper "Seeing the future: anticipatory eye gaze as a marker of memory." This study introduces the MEGA (Memory Episode Gaze Anticipation) paradigm, which utilizes eye tracking to quantify memory retrieval without relying on verbal reports. By monitoring anticipatory gaze patterns, we can index memory traces for events, providing a novel "no-report" method for assessing episodic memory.
